            "description": "The following API can be used to generate a unique ID based on a pattern specified by the user. The API can generate alphanumeric ID of a user specified length by passing the argument {alphanumeric:LENGTH} in the body, wherein \"LENGTH\" is to be replaced by a numeric value of the desired  length of the alphanumeric ID to be generated (ex- {alphanumeric:10} generates a 10 character unique alphanumeric ID). The API also supports adding the current date to the generated ID by passing the argument {timestamp:DATEFORMAT}, wherein \"DATEFORMAT\" is to be replaced by a valid Date Format such as \"DDMMYYYY\" , \"MMDDYYYY\", \"YYYYMMDD\" , etc. (ex- {timestamp:DDMMYYYY} would add the current date in the format of DDMMYYYY to the final generated ID). Other than the above arguments , The generated ID can contain any characters that are passed into the api, The order of the generated ID shall be in the same order in which the arguments and other characters are passed into the API.",
